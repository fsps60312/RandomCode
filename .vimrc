" " Semshi provides semantic highlighting for Python in Neovim.
" " Unlike regex-based syntax highlighters, Semshi understands Python code and performs static analysis as you type. It builds a syntax tree and symbol tables to highlight names based on their scope and context. This makes code easier to read and lets you quickly identify missing imports, unused arguments, misspelled names, and more.

" Python-mode is a Vim plugin that magically converts Vim into a Python IDE.
" 
" Why Python-mode?
" 
" Be more productive: Pymode saves time by bringing all the tools necessary for professional developers so that you can focus on bigger things. It has been finely tuned based on decades of experience working with Vim and is constantly kept up to date.
" Get smart assistance: Pymode knows all about your code. We use the best-in-class intellisense code completion, on-the-fly error checking and quick-fixes; easy project navigation and much more.
" Use the full power and capabilities of Vim: Unlike traditional IDEs which can only provide a small subset of Vim functionalities, you can do everything and anything that you can in Vim.
" Modular structure: We attempt to create Python-mode with the same principles of python: i.e. have a modular structure, so that as and when better libraries evolve, we can provide you the best experience, while abstracting the details so that you can get back to what you do best.
" Written mostly in Python: 96.1% written in Python. Well, we love Python :)
" The plugin contains all you need to develop python applications in Vim.
" 
" Support Python and 3.6+
" Syntax highlighting
" Virtualenv support
" Run python code (<leader>r)
" Add/remove breakpoints (<leader>b)
" Improved Python indentation
" Python motions and operators (]], 3[[, ]]M, vaC, viM, daC, ciM, ...)
" Improved Python folding
" Run multiple code checkers simultaneously (:PymodeLint)
" Autofix PEP8 errors (:PymodeLintAuto)
" Search in python documentation (<leader>K)
" Code refactoring
" Intellisense code-completion
" Go to definition (<C-c>g)
" And more, more ...
" See a screencast here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67OZNp9Z0CQ.

" Another old presentation here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhqsjUUHj6g.

" ALE makes use of NeoVim and Vim 8 job control functions and timers to run linters on the contents of text buffers and return errors as text is changed in Vim. This allows for displaying warnings and errors in files being edited in Vim before files have been saved back to a filesystem.
" 
" In other words, this plugin allows you to lint while you type.
" 
" ALE offers support for fixing code with command line tools in a non-blocking manner with the :ALEFix feature, supporting tools in many languages, like prettier, eslint, autopep8, and more.
" 
" ALE acts as a "language client" to support a variety of Language Server Protocol features, including:
" 
" Diagnostics (via Language Server Protocol linters)
" Go To Definition (:ALEGoToDefinition)
" Completion (Built in completion support, or with Deoplete)
" Finding references (:ALEFindReferences)
" Hover information (:ALEHover)
" Symbol search (:ALESymbolSearch)
" If you don't care about Language Server Protocol, ALE won't load any of the code for working with it unless needed. One of ALE's general missions is that you won't pay for the features that you don't use.
